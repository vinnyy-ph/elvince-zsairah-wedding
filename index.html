                                    <p>It was a high school classic: Elvince was the tall, silent type , while Zsairah was the short, bubbly and friendly girl who lit up the room. He towered over her, but she was the one who captured his attention.</p>
                                    <p>After Elvince's crush was spilled by a friend, three chaotic days of matchmaking, teasing, and conversation followed. On their last subject, while walking the corridor, the silent type executed a brave plan: he quickly pulled Zsairah's bag behind, stopping her, and in a moment of courage slipped his arm around her shoulders. Looking down at the girl who held his heart, he asked: "Zsai, mahal kita... mahal mo ba ako?" Then, he added, "Bukas ang sagot ha". Zsairah pulled her bag back and took off running, both hearts were throbbing with excitement and nerves. The walk home was an awkward, electric silence — until the very next day, November 26, 2008, she said yes, and the love story officially began.</p>

As dedicated math competition partners, they trained side-by-side. Zsairah, the smartest girl in the class, graduated as the Salutatorian, keeping their young love focused squarely on academics. Their relationship was constantly supervised — especially since Elvince's mother taught at the school — but it flourished under accepted guidance.</p>

                                    <p>Their young love took a necessary pause in 2012 when Zsairah dedicated herself entirely to her role as a church youth leader. After months of silence, they met to officially close their chapter, but destiny had intervened. Under the bustling city night, Elvince glanced upward and saw a star that shines so bright, and spontaneously whispered the words that changed everything: "Ang ganda ng star oh." Zsairah instantly broke down, tears streaming. This was the exact celestial sign she had requested in prayer: the one who would truly appreciate the night sky with her would be her forever. Their chapter wasn't closed—it was beginning anew, committed to balancing faith, studies, and a love written in the stars.</p>

                                    <p>Their commitment, renewed under the watchful stars, quickly matured into a powerful partnership. Supporting each other through college, they learned to balance their studies, faith, and relationship. They both graduated college and built their careers, trading late-night study sessions for weekly dates and  travels funded by their "adult money." They dedicated themselves not only to their shared path but to fostering each other's individual dreams, proving that true partnership means growing separately, yet always growing together for their future.</p>

With AirPods in and eyes closed, Zsairah listened to a song that perfectly captured the silent story of his heart. With fifteen years of shared love, he finally spoke the words he had always dreamed of: "Papoy, Will you marry me?" Zsairah said yes through happy tears, immediately punctuated by, "Ang pangit ng nails ko!" Their beloved furbaby, Luna, jumped right into them, making the promise official for their little family.</p>
